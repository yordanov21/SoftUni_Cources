	<h1>Elephant</h1>

	<p><b>Elephants</b> are mammals of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"
			title="Family (biology)">family</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephantidae"
			title="Elephantidae">Elephantidae</a> and the largest existing land animals. Three <a

		recognised: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_bush_elephant"
			title="African bush elephant">African bush elephant</a>, the <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_forest_elephant" title="African forest elephant">African forest
			elephant</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_elephant" title="Asian elephant">Asian
			elephant</a>. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proboscidea" title="Proboscidea">Proboscidea</a>;
		extinct members include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon" title="Mastodon">mastodons</a>. The
		family Elephantidae also contains several now-extinct
		groups, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammoth" title="Mammoth">mammoths</a> and <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight-tusked_elephant"
			title="Straight-tusked elephant">straight-tusked elephants</a>. <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_elephant" title="African elephant">African
			elephants</a> have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears,
		and convex or level backs. Distinctive features of all elephants include a long trunk, tusks,
		large ear flaps, massive legs, and tough but sensitive skin. The trunk, also called a <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proboscis" title="Proboscis">proboscis</a>, is used for
		breathing, bringing food and water to the mouth, and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived
		from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The
		large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication.
		The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column" title="Column">pillar</a>-like legs carry
		their great weight.
	</p>
	<p>Elephants are scattered throughout <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa"
			title="Sub-Saharan Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia"
			title="South Asia">South Asia</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia"

			Asia</a> and are found in different habitats, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savanna"
			title="Savanna">savannahs</a>, forests,
		deserts, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh" title="Marsh">marshes</a>. They are
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbivorous" class="mw-redirect" title="Herbivorous">herbivorous</a>, and
		they stay near water when it is accessible. They
		are considered to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_species" title="Keystone species">keystone
			species</a>, due to their impact on their environments.
		Other animals tend to keep their distance from elephants; the exception is their <a

			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_wild_dog" title="African wild dog">wild dogs</a>, which usually
		target only young elephants (calves).
		Elephants have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fission%E2%80%93fusion_society"
			title="Fission–fusion society">fission–fusion society</a>, in which multiple family groups
		come together to socialise. Females (cows) tend to live in family groups, which can consist of
		one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. The groups, which do not
		include bulls, are led by the (usually) oldest cow, known as the <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matriarchy" title="Matriarchy">matriarch</a>.
	</p>
	<p>Males (bulls) leave their family groups when they reach puberty, and may live alone or with other
		males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate. They enter a
		state of increased <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone" title="Testosterone">testosterone</a>
		and aggression known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musth" title="Musth">musth</a>, which helps them
		gain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(ethology)" title="Dominance (ethology)">dominance</a>
		over other males as well as reproductive success.
		Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long
		as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight,
		smell, and sound; elephants use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrasound"

	<h2>Characteristics</h2>

	<h3>Size</h3>

	<p>Elephants are the largest living terrestrial animals. African bush elephants are the largest
		species, with males being 304–336&nbsp;cm (10&nbsp;ft 0&nbsp;in–11&nbsp;ft 0&nbsp;in) tall at
		the shoulder with a body mass of 5.2–6.9&nbsp;t (5.7–7.6 short tons) and females standing
		247–273&nbsp;cm (8&nbsp;ft 1&nbsp;in–8&nbsp;ft 11&nbsp;in) tall at the shoulder with a body mass
		of 2.6–3.5&nbsp;t (2.9–3.9 short tons). Male Asian elephants are usually about 261–289&nbsp;cm
		(8&nbsp;ft 7&nbsp;in–9&nbsp;ft 6&nbsp;in) tall at the shoulder and 3.5–4.6&nbsp;t (3.9–5.1 short
		tons) whereas females are 228–252&nbsp;cm (7&nbsp;ft 6&nbsp;in–8&nbsp;ft 3&nbsp;in) tall at the
		shoulder and 2.3–3.1&nbsp;t (2.5–3.4 short tons). African forest elephants are the smallest
		species, with males usually being around 209–231&nbsp;cm (6&nbsp;ft 10&nbsp;in–7&nbsp;ft
		7&nbsp;in) tall at the shoulder and 1.7–2.3&nbsp;t (1.9–2.5 short tons). Male African bush
		elephants are typically 23% taller than females, whereas male Asian elephants are only around
		15% taller than females.<sup id="cite_ref-Larramendi,_A._2015_25-2" class="reference"><a

	<h3>Bones</h3>
	<p>The skeleton of the elephant is made up of 326–351 bones.<sup id="cite_ref-Shoshani68_36-0" class="reference"><a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani68-36">[36]</a></sup> The
		vertebrae are connected by tight joints, which limit the backbone's flexibility. African
		elephants have 21 pairs of ribs, while Asian elephants have 19 or 20 pairs.<sup id="cite_ref-37"
			class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup>
	</p>

	<h3>Head</h3>
	<p>An elephant's skull is resilient enough to withstand the forces generated by the leverage of the
		tusks and head-to-head collisions. The back of the skull is flattened and spread out, creating
		arches that protect the brain in every direction.<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup> The skull
		contains air cavities (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinus_(anatomy)"
			title="Sinus (anatomy)">sinuses</a>) that reduce the weight of the skull while maintaining
		overall strength. These cavities give the inside of the skull a <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeycomb" title="Honeycomb">honeycomb</a>-like
		appearance. The cranium is particularly large and provides enough room for the attachment of
		muscles to support the entire head. The lower jaw is solid and heavy.<sup id="cite_ref-Shoshani68_36-1"
			class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani68-36">[36]</a></sup>
		Because of the size of the head, the neck is relatively short to provide better support.<sup
			id="cite_ref-evolution_6-4" class="reference"><a

		Lacking a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimal_apparatus" title="Lacrimal apparatus">lacrimal

	<h3>Ears</h3>
	<p>Elephant ears have thick bases with thin tips. The ear flaps, or <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinna_(anatomy)" class="mw-redirect" title="Pinna (anatomy)">pinnae</a>,
		contain numerous blood vessels called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"
			title="Capillary">capillaries</a>. Warm blood
		flows into the capillaries, helping to release excess body heat into the environment. This
		occurs when the pinnae are still, and the animal can enhance the effect by flapping them. Larger
		ear surfaces contain more capillaries, and more heat can be released. Of all the elephants,
		African bush elephants live in the hottest climates, and have the largest ear flaps.<sup id="cite_ref-43"
			class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup> Elephants are

		trunk are separated.<sup id="cite_ref-evolution_6-5" class="reference"><a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-evolution-6">[6]</a></sup> The

		appendage. It contains up to 150,000 separate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_fascicle"
			title="Muscle fascicle">muscle
			fascicles</a>, with no bone and little fat. These paired muscles consist of two major types:

			title="Deciduous teeth">deciduous</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar"
			title="Premolar">premolars</a>, and 12 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"
			title="Molar (tooth)">molars</a>. Unlike most mammals, which <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_development" class="mw-redirect" title="Tooth development">grow
			baby teeth</a> and then replace them with a single permanent
		set of adult teeth, elephants are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphyodont"
			title="Polyphyodont">polyphyodonts</a> that have cycles of tooth rotation throughout their
		lives. The chewing teeth are replaced six times in a typical elephant's lifetime. Teeth are not
		replaced by new ones emerging from the jaws vertically as in most mammals. Instead, new teeth
		grow in at the back of the mouth and move forward to push out the old ones. The first chewing
		tooth on each side of the jaw falls out when the elephant is two to three years old. The second
		set of chewing teeth falls out at four to six years old. The third set falls out at 9–15 years
		of age, and set four lasts until 18–28 years of age. The fifth set of teeth falls out at the
		early 40s. The sixth (and usually final) set must last the elephant the rest of its life.
		Elephant teeth have loop-shaped dental ridges, which are thicker and more diamond-shaped in
		African elephants.<sup id="cite_ref-Shoshani70_50-0" class="reference"><a

	<h4>Tusks</h4>
	<p>The tusks of an elephant are modified second incisors in the upper jaw. They replace deciduous <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_teeth" class="mw-redirect" title="Milk teeth">milk
			teeth</a> at 6–12 months of age and grow continuously at about 17&nbsp;cm (7&nbsp;in) a
		year. A newly developed tusk has a smooth <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel"
			title="Tooth enamel">enamel</a> cap that eventually wears off. The <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin" title="Dentin">dentine</a> is known as <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory" title="Ivory">ivory</a> and its <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_section_(geometry)"
			title="Cross section (geometry)">cross-section</a> consists of crisscrossing line patterns,
		known as "engine turning", which create diamond-shaped areas. As a piece of living tissue, a
		tusk is relatively soft; it is as hard as the mineral <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcite"
			title="Calcite">calcite</a>. Much of the tusk
		can be seen outside; the rest is in a socket in the skull. At least one-third of the tusk
		contains the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_(tooth)" title="Pulp (tooth)">pulp</a>
		and some have nerves stretching to the tip. Thus it would be difficult to remove it without
		harming the animal. When removed, ivory begins to dry up and crack if not kept cool and moist.
		Tusks serve multiple purposes. They are used for digging for water, salt, and roots; debarking
		or marking trees; and for moving trees and branches when clearing a path. When fighting, they
		are used to attack and defend, and to protect the trunk.<sup id="cite_ref-Shoshani71_51-0" class="reference"><a

			left-handed</a>, elephants are usually right- or left-tusked.
		The dominant tusk, called the master tusk, is generally more worn down, as it is shorter with a
		rounder tip. For the African elephants, tusks are present in both males and females, and are
		around the same length in both sexes, reaching up to 300&nbsp;cm (9&nbsp;ft 10&nbsp;in),<sup
			id="cite_ref-Shoshani71_51-1" class="reference"><a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani71-51">[51]</a></sup> but
		those of males tend to be thicker.<sup id="cite_ref-52" class="reference"><a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup> In earlier
		times, elephant tusks weighing over 200 pounds (more than 90&nbsp;kg) were not uncommon, though
		it is rare today to see any over 100 pounds (45&nbsp;kg).<sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference"><a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup>
	</p>
	<p>In the Asian species, only the males have large tusks. Female Asians have very small tusks, or
		none at all.<sup id="cite_ref-Shoshani71_51-2" class="reference"><a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani71-51">[51]</a></sup>
		Tuskless males exist and are particularly common among Sri Lankan elephants.<sup id="cite_ref-54"
			class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup> Asian males
		can have tusks as long as Africans', but they are usually slimmer and lighter; the largest
		recorded was 302&nbsp;cm (9&nbsp;ft 11&nbsp;in) long and weighed 39&nbsp;kg (86&nbsp;lb).

	<h3>Skin</h3>
	<p>An elephant's skin is generally very tough, at 2.5&nbsp;cm (1&nbsp;in) thick on the back and
		parts of the head. The skin around the mouth, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"
			title="Anus">anus</a>, and inside of the ear is considerably thinner. Elephants typically
		have grey skin, but African elephants look brown or reddish after wallowing in coloured mud.
		Asian elephants have some patches of depigmentation, particularly on the forehead and ears and
		the areas around them. Calves have brownish or reddish hair, especially on the head and back. As
		elephants mature, their hair darkens and becomes sparser, but dense concentrations of hair and
		bristles remain on the end of the tail as well as the chin, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"
			title="Sex organ">genitals</a> and the areas
		around the eyes and ear openings. Normally the skin of an Asian elephant is covered with more
		hair than its African counterpart.<sup id="cite_ref-Shoshani66_61-0" class="reference"><a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani66-61">[61]</a></sup>
	</p>
	<p>An elephant uses mud as a sunscreen, protecting its skin from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"
			title="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> light.
		Although tough, an elephant's skin is very sensitive. Without regular <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mud_bath" title="Mud bath">mud baths</a> to protect it
		from burning, insect bites and moisture loss, an elephant's skin suffers serious damage. After
		bathing, the elephant will usually use its trunk to blow dust onto its body and this dries into
		a protective crust.
	</p>
	<p>Elephants have difficulty releasing heat through the skin because of their low <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-area-to-volume_ratio"
			title="Surface-area-to-volume ratio">surface-area-to-volume ratio</a>, which is many times
		smaller than that of a human. They have even been observed lifting up their legs, presumably in

	</p>

	<h3>Legs, locomotion, and posture</h3>
	<p>To support the animal's weight, an elephant's limbs are positioned more vertically under the body
		than in most other mammals. The long bones of the limbs have <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancellous_bone" class="mw-redirect" title="Cancellous bone">cancellous
			bone</a> in place of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_cavity"

				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani69-62">[62]</a></sup>
		Both the front and hind limbs can support an elephant's weight, although 60% is borne by the
		front.<sup id="cite_ref-cushion_63-0" class="reference"><a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-cushion-63">[63]</a></sup> Since
		the limb bones are placed on top of each other and under the body, an elephant can stand still
		for long periods of time without using much energy. Elephants are incapable of rotating their
		front legs, as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulna" title="Ulna">ulna</a> and <a

			class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani69-62">[62]</a></sup> In
		walking, the legs act as pendulums, with the hips and shoulders rising and falling while the
		foot is planted on the ground. With no "aerial phase", the fast gait does not meet all the
		criteria of running, although the elephant uses its legs much like other running animals, with
		the hips and shoulders falling and then rising while the feet are on the ground.<sup id="cite_ref-kinetics_66-0"
			class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-kinetics-66">[66]</a></sup>
		Fast-moving elephants appear to 'run' with their front legs, but 'walk' with their hind legs and
		can reach a top speed of 25&nbsp;km/h (16&nbsp;mph).<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_67-0" class="reference"><a

				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-ReferenceA-67">[67]</a></sup>
		During locomotion, the cushion pads expand and contract, and reduce both the pain and noise that
		would come from a very heavy animal moving.<sup id="cite_ref-cushion_63-2" class="reference"><a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-cushion-63">[63]</a></sup>
		Elephants are capable swimmers. They have been recorded swimming for up to six hours without
		touching the bottom, and have travelled as far as 48&nbsp;km (30&nbsp;mi) at a stretch and at
		speeds of up to 2.1&nbsp;km/h (1&nbsp;mph).<sup id="cite_ref-68" class="reference"><a

	<h3>Social organisation</h3>
	<p>Female elephants spend their entire lives in tight-knit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrilineality"
			title="Matrilineality">matrilineal</a>
		family groups, some of which are made up of more than ten members, including three mothers and
		their dependent offspring, and are led by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matriarchy"

		she no longer has the energy for the role;<sup id="cite_ref-Kingdon53_92-0" class="reference"><a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Kingdon53-92">[92]</a></sup> a

				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-95">[95]</a></sup>
	</p>
	<p>The social circle of the female elephant does not necessarily end with the small family unit. In
		the case of elephants in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amboseli_National_Park"
			title="Amboseli National Park">Amboseli National Park</a>, Kenya, a female's life involves
		interaction with other families, clans, and subpopulations. Families may associate and bond with
		each other, forming what are known as bond groups which typically made of two family groups.
		During the dry season, elephant families may cluster together and form another level of social
		organisation known as the clan. Groups within these clans do not form strong bonds, but they
		defend their dry-season ranges against other clans. There are typically nine groups in a clan.
		The Amboseli elephant population is further divided into the "central" and "peripheral"
		subpopulations.<sup id="cite_ref-Sukumar175_91-1" class="reference"><a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Sukumar175-91">[91]</a></sup>
	</p>
	<p>Some elephant populations in India and Sri Lanka have similar basic social organisations. There
		appear to be cohesive family units and loose aggregations. They have been observed to have
		"nursing units" and "juvenile-care units". In southern India, elephant populations may contain
		family groups, bond groups and possibly clans. Family groups tend to be small, consisting of one
		or two adult females and their offspring. A group containing more than two adult females plus
		offspring is known as a "joint family". Malay elephant populations have even smaller family
		units, and do not have any social organisation higher than a family or bond group.<sup
			id="cite_ref-Sukumar175_91-2" class="reference"><a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Sukumar175-91">[91]</a></sup>
		Groups of African forest elephants typically consist of one adult female with one to three
		offspring. These groups appear to interact with each other, especially at forest clearings.<sup

				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Sukumar175-91">[91]</a></sup>
	</p>

	<p>The social life of the adult male is very different. As he matures, a male spends more time at
		the edge of his group and associates with outside males or even other families. At Amboseli,
		young males spend over 80% of their time away from their families when they are 14–15. When
		males permanently leave, they either live alone or with other males. The former is typical of
		bulls in dense forests. Asian males are usually solitary, but occasionally form groups of two or
		more individuals; the largest consisted of seven bulls. Larger bull groups consisting of over 10
		members occur only among African bush elephants, the largest of which numbered up to 144
		individuals.<sup id="cite_ref-Sukumar179_96-0" class="reference"><a

	<h3>Sexual behaviour</h3>

	<h4>Musth</h4>
	<p>Adult males enter a state of increased <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"
			title="Testosterone">testosterone</a> known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musth"
			title="Musth">musth</a>. In a population in southern India, males first enter musth at the
		age of 15, but it is not very intense until they are older than 25. At Amboseli, bulls under 24
		do not go into musth, while half of those aged 25–35 and all those over 35 do. Young bulls
		appear to enter musth during the dry season (January–May), while older bulls go through it
		during the wet season (June–December). The main characteristic of a bull's musth is a fluid
		secreted from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporin" title="Temporin">temporal
			gland</a> that runs down the side of his face. He may urinate with his penis still in his <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penile_sheath" title="Penile sheath">sheath</a>, which
		causes the urine to spray on his hind legs. Behaviours associated with musth include walking
		with the head held high and swinging, picking at the ground with the tusks, marking, rumbling
		and waving only one ear at a time. This can last from a day to four months.<sup id="cite_ref-Sukumar100_99-0"
			class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Sukumar100-99">[99]</a></sup>
	</p>
	<p>Males become extremely aggressive during musth. Size is the determining factor in <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonistic_behaviour" title="Agonistic behaviour">agonistic</a>
		encounters when the individuals have the same
		condition. In contests between musth and non-musth individuals, musth bulls win the majority of
		the time, even when the non-musth bull is larger. A male may stop showing signs of musth when he
		encounters a musth male of higher rank. Those of equal rank tend to avoid each other. Agonistic
		encounters typically consist of threat displays, chases, and minor sparring with the tusks.
		Serious fights are rare.<sup id="cite_ref-Sukumar100_99-1" class="reference"><a

				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Sukumar126-117">[117]</a></sup> A
		new calf is usually the centre of attention for herd members. Adults and most of the other young
		will gather around the newborn, touching and caressing it with their trunks. For the first few
		days, the mother is intolerant of other herd members near her young. <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloparenting" title="Alloparenting">Alloparenting</a> –

	</p>
	<p>For the first few days, the newborn is unsteady on its feet, and needs the support of its mother.
		It relies on touch, smell, and hearing, as its eyesight is poor. It has little precise control
		over its trunk, which wiggles around and may cause it to trip. By its second week of life, the
		calf can walk more firmly and has more control over its trunk. After its first month, a calf can
		pick up, hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through the trunk and must
		drink directly through the mouth. It is still dependent on its mother and keeps close to
		her.<sup id="cite_ref-Sukumar126_117-1" class="reference"><a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Sukumar126-117">[117]</a></sup>
	</p>
	<p>For its first three months, a calf relies entirely on milk from its mother for nutrition, after
		which it begins to forage for vegetation and can use its trunk to collect water. At the same
		time, improvements in lip and leg coordination occur. Calves continue to suckle at the same rate
		as before until their sixth month, after which they become more independent when feeding. By
		nine months, mouth, trunk and foot coordination is perfected. After a year, a calf's abilities
		to groom, drink, and feed itself are fully developed. It still needs its mother for nutrition
		and protection from predators for at least another year. Suckling bouts tend to last 2–4 min/hr
		for a calf younger than a year and it continues to suckle until it reaches three years of age or
		older. Suckling after two years may serve to maintain growth rate, body condition and
		reproductive ability.<sup id="cite_ref-Sukumar126_117-2" class="reference"><a

	<h3>Communication</h3>
	<p>Touching is an important form of communication among elephants. Individuals greet each other by
		stroking or wrapping their trunks; the latter also occurs during mild competition. Older
		elephants use trunk-slaps, kicks, and shoves to discipline younger ones. Individuals of any age
		and sex will touch each other's mouths, temporal glands, and genitals, particularly during
		meetings or when excited. This allows individuals to pick up chemical cues. Touching is
		especially important for mother–calf communication. When moving, elephant mothers will touch
		their calves with their trunks or feet when side-by-side or with their tails if the calf is
		behind them. If a calf wants to rest, it will press against its mother's front legs and when it
		wants to suckle, it will touch her breast or leg.<sup id="cite_ref-122" class="reference"><a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-122">[122]</a></sup>

	<p>From various experiments, the elephant larynx is shown to produce various and complex vibratory
		phenomena. During <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo" title="In vivo">in vivo</a>
		situations, these phenomena could be triggered when the vocal folds and vocal tract interact to
		raise or lower the fundamental frequency.<sup id="cite_ref-infrasonic_128-1" class="reference"><a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-infrasonic-128">[128]</a></sup>
		One of the vibratory phenomena that occurred inside the larynx is alternating A-P
		(anterior-posterior) and P-A traveling waves, which happened due to the unusual larynx layout.
		This can be characterized by its unique glottal opening/closing pattern. When the trachea is at
		pressure of approximately 6 kPa, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonation"
			title="Phonation">phonation</a> begins in the larynx and the laryngeal tissue starts to
		vibrate at approximately 15 kPa. Vocal production mechanisms at certain frequencies are similar
		to that of humans and other mammals and the laryngeal tissues are subjected to self-maintained
		oscillations. Two biomechanical features can trigger these traveling wave patterns, which are a
		low fundamental frequency and in the vocal folds, increasing longitudinal tension.<sup

	<p>At Amboseli, several different infrasonic calls have been identified. A greeting rumble is
		emitted by members of a family group after having been separated for several hours. Contact
		calls are soft, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation" title="Modulation">unmodulated</a> sounds
		made by individuals that have been separated from
		their group and may be responded to with a "contact answer" call that starts out loud, but
		becomes softer. A "let's go" soft rumble is emitted by the matriarch to signal to the other herd
		members that it is time to move to another spot. Bulls in musth emit a distinctive,
		low-frequency pulsated rumble nicknamed the "motorcycle". Musth rumbles may be answered by the
		"female chorus", a low-frequency, modulated chorus produced by several cows. A loud
		postcopulatory call may be made by an oestrous cow after mating. When a cow has mated, her
		family may produce calls of excitement known as the "mating pandemonium".<sup id="cite_ref-Sukumar145_126-1"

			title="Seismic communication">communicate with seismics</a>, vibrations produced by impacts
		on the earth's surface or acoustical waves that travel through it. They appear to rely on their
		leg and shoulder bones to transmit the signals to the middle ear. When detecting seismic
		signals, the animals lean forward and put more weight on their larger front feet; this is known
		as the "freezing behaviour". Elephants possess several adaptations suited for seismic
		communication. The cushion pads of the feet contain cartilaginous nodes and have similarities to

	<h3>Warfare</h3>
	<p>Historically, elephants were considered formidable instruments of war. They were equipped with
		armour to protect their sides, and their tusks were given sharp points of iron or brass if they
		were large enough. War elephants were trained to grasp an enemy soldier and toss him to the
		person riding on them or to pin the soldier to the ground and impale him.<sup id="cite_ref-Shoshani146_163-0"

				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-:0-166">[166]</a></sup> Alexander

			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhus_of_Epirus" title="Pyrrhus of Epirus">Pyrrhus</a>

			title="Gladiator">gladiator</a> events. In
		the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_history" class="mw-redirect" title="Modern history">modern

			title="Zoo">zoos</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus" title="Circus">circuses</a> around
		the world. In

		animals do not reproduce well in captivity, due to the difficulty of handling musth bulls and
		limited understanding of female oestrous cycles. Asian elephants were always more common than
		their African counterparts in modern zoos and circuses. After CITES listed the Asian elephant
		under Appendix I in 1975, the number of African elephants in zoos increased in the 1980s,
		although the import of Asians continued. Subsequently, the US received many of its captive
		African elephants from Zimbabwe, which had an overabundance of the animals.<sup id="cite_ref-Shoshani184_168-0"

		As of 2000, around 1,200 Asian and 700 African elephants were kept in zoos and circuses. The
		largest captive population is in North America, which has an estimated 370 Asian and 350 African

	<p>Keeping elephants in zoos has met with some controversy. Proponents of zoos argue that they offer
		researchers easy access to the animals and provide money and expertise for preserving their
		natural habitats, as well as safekeeping for the species. Critics claim that the animals in zoos
		are under physical and mental stress.<sup id="cite_ref-169" class="reference"><a
